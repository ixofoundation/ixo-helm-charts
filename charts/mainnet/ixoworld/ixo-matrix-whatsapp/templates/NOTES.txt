1. Register the appservice with Synapse:
   - After the first run, the bridge writes registration to its data volume.
   - Copy registration from the bridge pod, e.g.:
     kubectl exec -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} deployment/{{ include "ixo-matrix-whatsapp.fullname" . }} -- cat /data/registration.yaml
   - Add that file to your Synapse config (app_service_config_files) and restart Synapse.

2. Point Synapse at this bridge:
   - Ensure homeserver.address in values is the URL Synapse is reachable at from the cluster.
   - Ensure appservice.address is the URL this bridge is reachable at from Synapse (e.g. http://{{ include "ixo-matrix-whatsapp.fullname" . }}:8008 if in the same namespace).

3. Link WhatsApp:
   - In Matrix, open a DM with @whatsappbot:{{ .Values.homeserver.domain }}
   - Send "help" then "login" and scan the QR code with WhatsApp (Linked Devices).
